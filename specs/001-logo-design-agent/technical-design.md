# Logo Design AI POC

## 1. Overview

### 1.1 POC objective

Build an async backend Logo Design Service for Step 1 -> Step 6 only.

In-scope:

- Step 1: intent detect
- Step 2: input extraction + reference analysis
- Step 3: required-field validation and clarification
- Step 4: design guideline inference
- Step 6: generate 3-4 logo options

Out-of-scope:

- Step 7: prompt-based editing
- Step 8: follow-up suggestions

### 1.2 Success metrics (POC acceptance targets)

- >= 90% requests extract brand_name and industry from user query.
- >= 90% requests that pass required-field gate produce valid `guideline` before image generation starts.
- >= 85% requests return 3-4 valid logo options.
- p95 job completion time <= 30s (from submit to completed).
- p95 time to first status transition (queued -> processing) <= 5s.
- On failure, return actionable error + retry hint <= 5s.

### 1.3 User Journey (5-step POC flow)

1. **User enters logo request** → Submit query with optional brand details
2. **System shows thinking** → Frontend shows "Processing..." with streaming reasoning visible
3. **If missing info** → System asks clarification question (e.g., "What is your brand name?"), user answers in chat
4. **System generates guideline** → Design guideline created, user sees it via stream
5. **System generates logo options** → 3-4 logo options generated and displayed
6. **User sees results** → Complete logos with brand context

Key UX point: User does NOT wait or resubmit; everything is interactive within one task session.

### 1.4 Technical constraints

- Primary endpoints: async `POST /internal/v1/tasks/submit` and `GET /internal/v1/tasks/{task_id}/status`.
- Primary task type for this POC: `logo_generate`.
- Required fields (mandatory before generation):
  - `brand_name` (company/product name)
  - `industry` (business category or context)
- Single request per job; input may be partial when `use_session_context` is enabled.
- Required-field precedence is fixed: explicit fields in request > extracted fields from new query > stored session context.
- Session scope is per `session_id` with short-term memory reuse across jobs.
- Provider switching must not change task semantics or output contract.

## 3. System Architecture

### 3.1 Overview

#### 3.1.1 Why this solution

This architecture is designed for strict quality gating in POC with interactive task completion: submit once, then interactively complete the task via streaming (visible thinking + clarification) and async generation.

Key reasons:

1. Fail-fast required-field validation enforces required design inputs before generation begins.
2. Hybrid execution improves UX: Stage A+B stream reasoning in real time, Stage C runs async for image generation.
3. All processing happens server-side; FE does not hold the connection.
4. Session context is explicit and propagated between tools for deterministic behavior.
5. In POC, planner is simplified to rule-based routing inside a single worker process.

    P <-. full context .-> CTX
    O <-. full context .-> CTX
    TS -. task output only .-> O
```

**Note for POC:** Planner, Observer, and Task Workers are logically separated but implemented as a single worker service to keep implementation simple. They can be decoupled into separate microservices in production.

### 3.2 Architecture principles

- Task-first:
  - Business capability exposed as `logo_generate` in this phase.
  - Routing by `task_type`, no endpoint-specific business hardcoding.
- Schema-first:
  - All contracts validated by Pydantic.
  - Required-field gate is encoded as schema and validator rules.
- Async job-based:
  - Hybrid execution is used:
    - Stage A+B: SSE streaming for visible process thinking.
    - Stage C: async image task with polling.
  - `POST /internal/v1/tasks/submit` creates task and returns `task_id`.
  - `GET /internal/v1/tasks/{task_id}/status` is used primarily for Stage C result polling.
- Context-first tool handoff:
  - Every step reads/writes the same session memory snapshot.
  - Tools return deltas only; worker merges and persists checkpoints.
  - Tool swap must preserve context I/O contract.

#### 3.2.1 Memory flow contract (context engineering style)

This section defines memory behavior so the pipeline is deterministic and easy to reason about:

1. **Worker keeps execution state**:
  - Worker owns `task_id`, `current_step`, round counters, and status transitions.
  - Task-local runtime state is not stored in tool adapters.
2. **Tools are stateless and receive lightweight context**:
  - Input to each tool is scoped to required fields only (`session_id`, required field state, relevant context slice).
  - Tools do not own global session memory.
3. **Tools return deltas, worker merges**:
  - Each tool returns only changed fields (delta), not full state overwrite.
  - Worker merges delta into current state using fixed precedence rules.
4. **Persist checkpoints in SessionContextStore**:
  - Save checkpoint after Stage A (required fields), Stage B (guideline), Stage C (final output URLs).
  - Cross-job reuse always loads from SessionContextStore.
5. **Use `context_version` for stale-write protection**:
  - Every write validates expected `context_version`.
  - On version mismatch, worker reloads latest context and retries merge.

#### 3.2.2 POC simplification notes

This design is prepared for production scale but POC implementation can be simplified:

- **Planner**: In POC, simplified to rule-based routing (no multi-model decision tree); planner logic is embedded in worker startup.
- **Queue**: In POC, queue is used only for Stage C image generation; Stage A+B runs synchronously within the stream handler.
- **Observer**: In POC, observer check is simple gate logic (required fields present?); no multi-path decision tree.

These can be formalized and decoupled in subsequent phases as system scales.

### 3.3 Component breakdown (tool-level)

| Component or Tool | Spec step | Role | Model Type | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| IntentDetectTool | Step 1 | Detect logo design intent and route flow | Low-latency text LLM | Deterministic classifier; if logo intent is detected, switch from generic image generation flow to Logo Design flow |
| InputExtractionTool | Step 2 | Extract brand_name, industry, style, color, symbol from text | Text LLM with structured output | Returns structured JSON (style/color optional) |
| ReferenceImageAnalyzeTool | Step 2 | Analyze reference image style/color/typography/iconography | Multimodal LLM | Optional when references provided |
| ClarificationLoopTool | Step 3 | Generate targeted clarification questions for missing required fields | Text LLM for question generation | If required fields are missing: system asks clarification question via streaming (e.g. "What is your brand name?"), user answers directly in chat, system continues within same session |
| DesignInferenceTool | Step 4 | Infer final guideline from completed context | Text LLM for design reasoning | Returns guideline JSON |
| LogoGenerationTool | Step 6 | Generate 3-4 logo options | Fast image generation model | Throughput-optimized |
| StorageTool | Shared | Upload images and return URLs | Cloud storage API | Used by generation |
| SessionContextTool | Shared | Read/update context snapshot per session and key job checkpoints | Context adapter over cache or DB | Required for deterministic tool swap |

### 3.4 End-to-end pipeline

POC exposes one external task type: `logo_generate`.

### 3.5 Reuse and extensibility

- Add fields in extraction or guideline:
  - Extend schema and prompt templates only.
  - API contract stays unchanged.
- Add edit phase in next release:
  - Register `logo_edit` task type and add Stage D for Step 7.
  - Reuse same context and job semantics.
- Add provider:
  - Replace generation adapter only.
  - No change in worker state machine.

class LogoGenerateOutput(BaseModel):

    options: List[LogoOption]


class JobSubmitResponse(BaseModel):
    task_id: str
    status: Literal["queued"]
    created_at: str  # ISO8601


class JobStatusResponse(BaseModel):
    task_id: str
    status: Literal["queued", "processing", "completed", "failed"]
    progress_percent: Optional[int] = None  # 0-100 if processing
    result: Optional[LogoGenerateOutput] = None  # populated when completed

    suggested_questions: List[SuggestedQuestion] = Field(default_factory=list)  # populated when failed
    retry_after_seconds: Optional[int] = None  # populated when failed
```

Validation rules:

- `query` is required and non-empty after trim.
- `variation_count` must be 3 or 4.
- Required-field gate: brand_name AND industry must both be present before guideline generation.
- If extraction confidence is **below threshold** (e.g., < 70%), system SHOULD trigger clarification question instead of guessing; this avoids silent failures and improves UX transparency.
- Merge precedence is fixed: explicit fields in request > extracted fields from new query > stored context for same `session_id`.
  - **Example:**
    - User provides `brand_name` explicitly in request → use it
    - Else, extract `brand_name` from query via LLM
    - Else, reuse `brand_name` from previous session
- Empty-value precedence policy:
  - explicit empty string (e.g., `brand_name=""`) is treated as missing and does not override non-empty extracted/session value.
  - explicit `null` is treated as "not provided" and falls through to lower-precedence sources.
  - explicit empty optional lists (e.g., `style_preference=[]`) are valid explicit overrides.
- If `use_session_context=true`, backend may use stored context as the last precedence layer.
- If required fields are still missing after merge, return failed job with `error_code`, `missing_fields`, and `suggested_questions`.
- On `status="failed"` with `error_code="MISSING_REQUIRED_FIELDS"`, `missing_fields` and `suggested_questions` must be populated.

### 4.3 Concrete endpoint I/O

- `GET /internal/v1/tasks/{task_id}/stream` (SSE stream for Stage A + B)
  - Behavior:
    - stream incremental events while extraction and guideline inference are running.
    - if required fields are missing, emit `clarification` event with `missing_fields` and `suggested_questions`.
    - FE sends clarification answer and pipeline continues in same task/session.
    - if guideline is ready, final event includes `generate_hq_task_id` for Stage C polling.
  - Streaming events are used to render:
    - "Thinking..." messages
    - Step-by-step reasoning (Input understanding, style inference, field validation)
    - Clarification questions
    - This creates a ChatGPT-like experience where user sees agent's reasoning in real-time.
  - Streaming event schema:
    ```json
    {
      "type": "thinking | clarification | guideline_ready | error",
      "step": "extraction | clarification | inference",
      "content": "string",
      "metadata": {
        "task_id": "uuid",
        "missing_fields": ["brand_name"],
        "suggested_questions": [{"key": "brand_name", "question": "..."}],
        "generate_hq_task_id": "uuid-stage-c"
      }
    }
    ```
  - Example final SSE event (guideline ready):
    ```json
    {
      "type": "guideline_ready",
      "task_id": "uuid",
      "generate_hq_task_id": "uuid-stage-c",
      "guideline": { /* DesignGuideline */ }
    }
    ```

- `POST /internal/v1/tasks/{task_id}/clarification` (submit clarification answer)
  - Input:
    - `answers` (required, key-value map for missing fields)
  - Output:
    ```json
    {
      "task_id": "uuid",
      "status": "processing",
      "message": "clarification accepted"
    }
    ```

- `POST /internal/v1/tasks/submit` (submit job)
  - Input:
    - `task_type` (required: `logo_generate`)
    - `session_id` (required)
    - `query` (required: user request for extraction)
    - `brand_name` (optional explicit override)
    - `industry` (optional explicit override)
    - `style_preference` (optional explicit override)
    - `color_preference` (optional explicit override)
    - `symbol_preference` (optional explicit override)
    - `references` (optional: list of ReferenceImage)
    - `use_session_context` (optional, default true)
    - `variation_count` (optional, default 4, range 3-4)
    - `output_format` (optional, default "png")
    - `output_size` (optional, default "1024x1024")
  - Output (JobSubmitResponse):
    ```json
    {
      "task_id": "uuid",
      "status": "queued",
      "created_at": "2026-03-24T12:00:00Z"
    }
    ```

- `GET /internal/v1/tasks/{task_id}/status` (check job status)
  - Path params: `task_id`
  - Output (JobStatusResponse, while processing):
    ```json
    {
      "task_id": "uuid",
      "status": "processing",
      "progress_percent": 45
    }
    ```
  - Progress mapping (for UI progress bar only, not exposed as detailed steps to user):
    - 0-20: extraction
    - 20-40: guideline inference
    - 40-100: image generation (increment per image completion)
  - Output (JobStatusResponse, when completed):
    ```json
    {
      "task_id": "uuid",
      "status": "completed",
      "result": {
        "guideline": { /* DesignGuideline */ },
        "required_field_state": { /* RequiredFieldState */ },
        "options": [ /* List[LogoOption] */ ]
      }
    }
    ```
  - Output (JobStatusResponse, if failed):
    ```json
    {
      "task_id": "uuid",
      "status": "failed",
      "error_code": "MISSING_REQUIRED_FIELDS",
      "error": "Missing required fields after merge precedence",
      "missing_fields": ["brand_name", "industry"],
      "suggested_questions": [
        {
          "key": "brand_name",
          "question": "What is your company or product name?"
        },
        {
          "key": "industry",
          "question": "What industry is your business in?"
        }
      ],
      "retry_after_seconds": 60
    }
    ```
  - Context behavior:
    - merge precedence is fixed: explicit request fields > extracted query fields > stored context in same `session_id`
    - required-field gate uses interactive clarification: missing fields emit stream clarification event and continue in same task/session after FE sends answers
    - result metadata includes final `required_field_state`

1. `imagen-4.0-fast-generate-001` is clearly fastest in current tracing run.
2. `gemini-2.5-flash` gives strong speed/cost balance for extraction and clarification.
3. OpenAI fallback keeps multi-provider resilience for production incidents.

## 5. Risks and open issues

### 5.1 Latency

Risk:

- Job completion may exceed p95 target depending on provider queue and image generation latency.

Mitigation:

- Parallel image generation where provider permits.
- Timeout + retry for transient provider failures.
- Queue scaling policy when backlog grows.
- Circuit breaker for provider outages.

### 5.2 Required-field validation quality

Risk:

- User intent may not include brand_name or industry explicitly; fail-fast may increase first-attempt failure rate.

Mitigation:

- Extract brand_name and industry early (Step 2) with high-confidence NLP.
- Return structured failure payload (`error_code`, `missing_fields`, `suggested_questions`) for FE-guided resubmission.
- Prioritize targeted suggested questions (e.g., "What is your company name?" before "What industry?").
- Allow inference from context (e.g., "design a logo for a fintech startup" → industry=fintech).

### 5.3 Cost

Risk:

- Failed attempts (missing required fields) and 3-4 image outputs increase cost per successful request.

Mitigation:

- Track cost per `task_id` and `session_id`.
- Cache extracted context in session and avoid redundant re-analysis.
- Keep benchmark table refreshed each milestone.

### 5.4 Open technical decisions

- SSE transport policy: heartbeat interval, reconnect strategy, and stream timeout policy.
- Signed URL TTL policy by asset type.
- Job result retention: how long to keep completed job results available.
- Session context TTL and reset policy (auto expiry only vs manual reset endpoint).
- Default guideline style when `style_preference` is not provided (infer from industry vs hardcoded default).
- Fallback generation model if primary `gemini-3.1-flash-image-preview` fails mid-job.
